> **Powerful AI tools in less than 100 lines each.** No bloat, just results.

Because naming variables IS hard, writing READMEs sucks, and your commit messages could use some work.

## 🎯 Quick Start

Get started in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/josharsh/100LinesOfAICode.git
cd 100LinesOfAICode

# Install dependencies
pip install anthropic requests

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Try your first tool!
python week-recap/recap.py
```
## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Missing API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found`)**  
  Set the environment variable first: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"`  
  Get your key at `https://console.anthropic.com/`.

- **API or network errors**  
  Terminal AI automatically retries Anthropic calls **3 times** with a short backoff.  
  If errors persist, check your internet connection or try again later.

- **Command timed out**  
  Shell commands are limited to **30 seconds** to keep the experience responsive.  
  Try a narrower request or run the suggested command manually in your terminal.
  
## 💡 Featured Examples

### Never Forget What You Did

```bash
python week-recap/recap.py

📊 Your Week: Nov 18-22, 2025

🎯 Highlights:
• Shipped user dashboard (merged PR #234)
• Fixed critical login bug affecting 2.3K users
• Code reviewed 12 PRs across 3 repos

💬 Copy-Paste Ready:
"This week I shipped the user dashboard, resolved a critical
auth bug affecting 2.3K users, and reviewed 12 PRs."

✅ Ready for your standup!
```

### Get Roasted by Your Own Code

```bash
python roast-commits/roaster.py

🏆 HALL OF SHAME

1. "asdf"
   👉 Did your cat walk on the keyboard?

2. "fix stuff"
   👉 Wow. Such detail. Very helpful.

3. "final FINAL v3"
   👉 Commitment issues much?

📊 YOUR GRADE: D+
You're better than 12% of developers!
```

### Stop Naming Things Wrong

```bash
python name-it/namer.py

What does this variable store?
> user's email address

📝 Best: userEmail (camelCase - most common)
   Alt: user_email (Python style)
   Simple: email (context-dependent)

💡 Tip: Python uses snake_case for variables!
```

## 📖 Philosophy

### Why 100 Lines?

**Constraint breeds creativity.** When you have 100 lines:
- Every line matters
- No framework bloat
- Easy to understand
- Easy to modify
- Actually read the code in minutes

### The Truth About Frameworks

```python
# LangChain: 10,000+ lines of abstraction
from langchain import complicated_chains

# This repo: Direct and clear
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(...)
```

**You learn more. You understand more. You build better.**

### Mass Market > Technical Brilliance

The best Udemy courses aren't from MIT professors.
The most popular dev tools aren't the most advanced.
**The most viral tools solve universal problems simply.**

## 🤝 Contributing

We love contributions! Here's how:

### Adding a New Tool

1. **Solve a real problem** - Must be something developers actually complain about
2. **Keep it ≤100 lines** - Constraint is the feature
3. **Make it shareable** - "OMG look at this!" factor
4. **Write a great README** - Sell the problem, then the solution

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
